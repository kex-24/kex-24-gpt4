# Bolibompa Dragons - Java Object Modeling Task

Due Date: **Friday 15th September**

## Instructions
For instructions on how to do and submit the assignment, please see the assignments section of the course instructions.

## Preparation
Read and answer all questions in the module on "Looking Inside Classes," available through the course's main page or direct link.

## Learning Goals
This week focuses on:
* Designing Java classes
* Using instance fields
* Writing a constructor method
* Implementing getters and setters
* Employing the dot operator
* Outputting to the terminal
* Utilizing the `main` method
* Understanding scope and variable shadowing

## Troubleshooting Guide
If you encounter any problems:
1. Check the posted issues under the help section. Your question might already be answered.
2. If not, post a new question by creating a new issue.
3. Alternatively, seek direct help during the weekly lab sessions.

## Assignment
In the mystical land of Bolibompa, dragons of various kinds roam freely. Your task is to model these dragons in Java. Use your imagination or refer to Bolibompa's rich lore for inspiration.

### Exercise 2.0 Our dragon-adventure begins!

Start by creating a new Java file named `Dragon.java`. Define a `Dragon` class with a main method. Initialize variables to represent a Dragon's name, health points (hp), attack power, defense power, and whether it's flying or not.

### Exercise 2.1 More dragons
Create two additional dragon objects. Examine and discuss scalability and maintenance issues with this approach.

### Exercise 2.2 -- Fields
Transition from local variables in the main method to class fields. Write a main method that creates a `Dragon` object and assigns it properties using these fields.

### Exercise 2.3 -- Getters and Setters
Implement accessors and mutators for the Dragon class fields to practice encapsulation.

### Exercise 2.4 -- Constructor
Define a constructor for the `Dragon` class that allows setting all the dragon properties at the object creation stage.

### Exercise 2.5 -- More dragons, (again)
Use the constructor to create multiple dragon objects efficiently.

### Exercise 2.6 -- `printInfo()`
Implement a method called `printInfo` within the Dragon class, to neatly print a dragon's details to the terminal.

### Exercise 2.7 -- Dragon, breathe fire!
Add a method that models dragons breathing fire at each other. This method should take another dragon object as a parameter to represent the target.

### Exercise 2.8 -- Variable Shadowing
Investigate and provide solutions for variable shadowing within your Dragon class, especially focusing on the constructor and methods.

## Checklist
* Initialize multiple dragons in the main method (optional).
* Use fields in the Dragon class to represent name, hp, attack, defense, and flying status.
* Utilize getters and setters to access and modify dragon attributes.
* Build a constructor for detailed and efficient dragon object creation.
* Design a `printInfo` method to display dragon details.
* Add a "breathe fire" interaction method between dragons.
* Study and address variable shadowing within your class.
